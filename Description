Text-to-SQL Agent is an intelligent system that allows users to query databases using plain natural language instead of writing SQL manually. For example, a user could type “Show me all users who registered last month”, and the agent would automatically generate the corresponding SQL query, such as SELECT * FROM users WHERE registration_date >= '2025-09-01';.
The process typically involves three main components: (1) natural language understanding to interpret user intent and extract entities or conditions, (2) query generation using large language models or fine-tuned transformers trained on SQL data, and (3) validation and execution against the target database to ensure correctness and security.
This project can integrate with Artemis Plan to automatically handle dataset schema extraction, intent detection, SQL synthesis, and iterative correction based on validation feedback, making it ideal for business dashboards, data analysis tools, or chatbot interfaces that need database access without requiring SQL expertise.
